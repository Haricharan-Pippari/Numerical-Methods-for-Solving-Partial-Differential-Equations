# Numerical-Methods-for-Solving-Partial-Differential-Equations

The **Main.m** file contains the main code which EXECUTES multiple numerical methods.

This core solves 3 Problems:

1. 1-D Diffusion equation for an initial square wave.
2. 1-D Linear convection equation for an initial sinusoidal wave using the Upwind approach, Lax-Wendroff, and Lax-Fredrichs approach then comparing it with theoretical solution.
3. 1-D Non-Linear Burgers' equation for an initial Heaviside function using Richtmyer and MacCormack schemes.
4. Wave equation for given boundary and initial conditions, using explicit and implicit Euler approach for different CFL numbers and also plotting errors.

**Make sure that Main.m and all other function files are in the same folder to execute without errors**
